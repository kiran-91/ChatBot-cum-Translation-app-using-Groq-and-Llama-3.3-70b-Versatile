# Chatbot & Language Translation App using Groq and Llama 3.3 Versatile

## Project Overview

This project combines two powerful AI functionalities into a multipage Streamlit application:

1. **Chatbot**: An intelligent conversational agent built using Groq and Meta's Llama-3.3-70b-Versatile model, capable of answering user queries accurately and contextually.
2. **Language Translation**: A robust tool for translating text into multiple languages, leveraging the same underlying AI model for high-quality translations.

This application demonstrates how AI models can be utilized for diverse use cases in a seamless and interactive user interface. It showcases the versatility and potential of advanced large language models in providing solutions to everyday tasks. By combining chatbot and translation capabilities, this project addresses both conversational and linguistic needs, offering a practical and engaging user experience. The intuitive design ensures accessibility for users with varying technical expertise.

Whether you're seeking quick answers to queries or translating text into a preferred language, this application serves as a powerful example of integrating cutting-edge AI technology into real-world applications
